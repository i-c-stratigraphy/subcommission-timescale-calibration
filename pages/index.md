The International Subcommission on Timescale Calibration is an effort to provide a platform for promoting integration between the traditionally stratigraphic communities of the ICS with the radioisotopic and numerical stratigraphic communities that historically have not been a central component of the ICS enterprise. The objective of this subcommission is not to ‘certify’ or ‘approve’ any particular numerical calibration of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, but rather, to provide advice and counsel to existing ICS Subcommissions on geochronological issues, to delineate best practices and the role of inter-laboratory calibrations to chronostratigraphic and timescale problems, and to provide a venue for increasing collaboration between chronostratigraphic and geochronologic research. Our efforts are to support the growing movement of geoscientists who increasingly work at the intersection of time and stratigraphy.
